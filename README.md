===========

Web app for recording, viewing, and analyzing Pomodoro data. 

Name
----

Named after the bannockburn cocktail (made from Scotch, tomato juice, and a
dash of Worcestershire sauce). You put in your Pomodoro data, bannockburn does
some number crunching (turning your Pomos into tomato juice) and adds a bit of
spice with D3 (Scotch and Worcestershire sauce).
