bannockburn
===========

Web app for recording, viewing, and analyzing Pomodoro data. 

### Name

Named after the bannockburn cocktail (made from Scotch, tomato juice, and a
dash of Worcestershire sauce). You put in your Pomodoro data, bannockburn does
some number crunching (turning your Pomos into tomato juice), does some magical
analysis (the Scotch) and adds a bit of spice with D3 (dash of Worcestershire
sauce).
